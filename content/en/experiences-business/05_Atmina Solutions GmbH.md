My work at Atmina Solutions consisted of the development of high-quality Web applications. We worked in autonomous teams each of them responsible for their products.

I was hired as a Frontend Developer and ended up working as a Full Stack Developer: I developed and expanded existing Continuous Integration pipelines and was able to take an in-depth look at the integration of _End to End Tests_ and different ways to deploy and run applications via _Docker_ containers through _Docker Compose_ and _Kubernetes_.

I was involved in creating UI Concepts and Responsive Designs for Web Applications.

I greatly refined my skillset and learned about new technologies including _Angular_, _Docker_, _Docker Compose_, _Kubernetes_, _Git_, _GitLab_, Continuous Integration, DevOps, _Figma_ and _IntelliJ DataGrip_.
