I was responsible for the creation of the Chakra Evolution website. It is powered by WordPress with the WooCoommerce plugin. I build the Chakra Evolution template from scratch to fit the ideas I had and to learn about the template creation in WordPress.

I was able to take an in-depth look into email server configuration and administration, web server setup, maintenance, support and overall technical administration and learned a lot in the process.
