Working at Rossmann presented me with the opportunity to apply the skills I learned at university and even more learn through practical application. My team and me developed applications for internal use. They helped the Purchasing department to maintain data about products that were important for transportation, storage, placement in stores (layout), legal regulations and Sales.

In addition to maintaining the applications for collecting and storing the product data, we maintained and expanded the infrastructure for the distribution of the data inside the company. That involved planning and implementing new services and web services. The product data was used amongst other things for reports, coupons, applications from other teams and the website.

I learned how to work in a team and I learned working with SCRUM to develop software. I gained insight into how large corporations operate and manage problems. I learned about the overall complexity and real-world problems in software development. Also, I experienced what it means to run applications in production environments.

I expanded my skill set with practical knowledge about _Java_, IntelliJ IDEs, REST APIs, Continuous Integration, _JIRA_, _Jenkins_, _Bamboo_ and _Git_.
