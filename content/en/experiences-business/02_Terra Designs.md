I set up an online shop for a jewellery manufacturer in Australia. This included gathering content, making photos, selecting and manipulating a template, importing the content and handing over the online shop with instructions on how to work with it. This task also led me to create a design for a product display stand that would be used in stores.

The online shop was powered by a WordPress installation with the WooCommerce plugin. I searched for a simple professional looking template that provided the features I was looking for. I created the content, namely photographed, edited and categorized hundreds of pieces of jewellery. I shot videos of the process involved to create specific kinds of jewellery. Last but not least I set up the payment gateway and tested the whole setup.
