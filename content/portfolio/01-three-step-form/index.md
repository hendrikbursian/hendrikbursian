## Goal

The goal of this project was the creation of a **digital questionaire** from a reference form to analyse the responses for the recommendation of loans & insurances to the user via an existing _REST API_.

## Highlights

Highlights included are the _automated scrolling_, the _keyboard bindings_ the and _fluid user experience (UX)_. I paid particular attention to the _behaviour & look_ of the input fields and to the _timing_ of the animations to make it feel fluid.

## Technologies

I used **[Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/)** in conjunction with the **[@vue/composition-api](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/)** plugin and **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**. For the style foundation I used **[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, which I configured with the client's colors and gradients. For the scroll animations I used the **[GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)** library. These technologies allowed me to quickly progress and to respond to change requests after the clients reviews.
